# Restaurants
This is an exercise in using pandas in Python.

OBJECTIVE: 
Use Pandas to retrieve data from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/restaurant-data-with-consumer-ratings. 

REQUIREMENTS:
books.py was written using Python version 3.9.7.

MAINTENANCE:
This repository will likely not be updated after 1/11/2022.

CONTENTS: 
csv_files (folder) - contains all .csv files used in Restaurants.py
Restaurants.py - main python file. loads in .csv files and queries for prompted data as shown in the comments.

DESIGN:
The code in Restaurants.py is written in one block without the use of functions. 
Since the purpose of this project was to become familiarized with pandas and not for repeatability,
little thought went into the design.
